This repository contains an anonymized version of the project. Fictional beer names, inspired by pets and creative input from friends, have been used to maintain client confidentiality while showcasing the full capabilities of the dashboard. 

# Beer Inventory Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a comprehensive beer inventory analysis dashboard for a local bar and kitchen. Working closely with the bar director, I designed and implemented a system to analyze beer inventory, sales, and pouring efficiency over a four-month period, covering various beer products in both kegs and bottles.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and transformation from wide to long format
- Custom calculations for Expected Pour Count and Pour Efficiency
- Interactive dashboard with filters for product, month, and container type
- Visualizations including gauge charts, time-series analysis, and product comparisons
- Anonymized dataset with creative, fictional beer names for portfolio presentation

## Technologies Used

- Google Sheets for initial data handling and calculations
- Google Looker Studio for dashboard creation and visualization
- Adobe Express for fictional logo creation

## Challenges and Solutions

- Limited date range: Recommended future implementation of extended data collection
- Inventory tracking uncertainties: Flagged for clarification with client
- Pour size variations: Implemented standardized pour counts while noting potential real-world variations

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and verification
- Advanced spreadsheet formula creation
- Data visualization and dashboard design
- Problem-solving and adaptability in tool selection
- Collaboration with non-technical stakeholders

## Future Recommendations

- Extend data collection period for more comprehensive trend analysis
- Incorporate event data to correlate with sales patterns
- Implement forecasting elements for inventory planning



Personal Touch
The project includes a fictional branding element, "Turtle's Tap," inspired by my cat Turtle. This personal touch demonstrates the ability to blend professional analysis with engaging, relatable elements.
