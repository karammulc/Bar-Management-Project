# Bar Management Project

This repository contains an anonymized version of a beer inventory analysis project for a local bar and kitchen. Fictional beer names, inspired by pets and creative input from friends, have been used to maintain client confidentiality while showcasing the full capabilities of the dashboard.

## Project Overview

Working closely with the bar director, I designed and implemented a comprehensive system to analyze beer inventory, sales, and pouring efficiency over a four month period. The project covers various beer products in both kegs and bottles, providing valuable insights for inventory management and sales strategies.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and transformation from wide to long format
- Custom calculations for Expected Pour Count and Pour Efficiency
- Interactive dashboard with filters for product, month, and container type
- Visualizations including gauge charts, time series analysis, and product comparisons
- Anonymized dataset with creative, fictional beer names for portfolio presentation

## Technologies Used

- Google Sheets: Initial data handling and calculations
- Google Looker Studio: Dashboard creation and visualization
- Adobe Express: Fictional logo creation

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Limited date range:** Recommended future implementation of extended data collection
- **Inventory tracking uncertainties:** Flagged for clarification with client, collaborated for better understanding of provided data.
- **Pour size variations:** Implemented standardized pour counts while noting potential realistic variations

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning, transformation and verification
- Advanced spreadsheet formula creation
- Data visualization and dashboard design
- Problem solving and adaptability in tool selection
- Collaboration with non technical stakeholders

## Future Recommendations

- Extend data collection period for more comprehensive trend analysis
- Incorporate event data to correlate with sales patterns
- Implement forecasting elements for inventory planning

## Dashboard Highlights

- Interactive filters for Product, Month, and Type (Kegs/Bottles)
- Key metrics: Expected Pours, Sold Pours, Pour Difference, % of Expected Pours Sold
- Visualizations: Stacked bar chart comparing Expected vs Sold Pours by product type
- Scatter plot of Expected vs Sold Pours
- "Sold Pours by Month" bar chart
- Gauge showing overall "% of Expected Pours Sold" with conditional labeling feature
- Product performance table
- Inventory count breakdown by product and type
- Financial data, including Cost by Unit and Total Order Cost

## Next Steps

- Incorporate remaining inventory data for a complete view of inventory movement.
- Develop short term operational insights given the limited historical data.
- Emphasize consistent data collection for future long term analysis capabilities.


The project includes a fictional name for our annomitized bar name, "Turtle's Tap," inspired by my cat Turtle.
